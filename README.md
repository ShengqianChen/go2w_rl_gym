This repository offers a quick-start, lightweight approach to controlling a quadruped robot Go2W using reinforcement learning, which is built upon the support and contributions of the following open-source projects. Special thanks to:

- [legged\_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym): The foundation for training and running codes.
- [rsl\_rl](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl.git): Reinforcement learning algorithm implementation.
- [unitree\_sdk2\_python](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python.git): Hardware communication interface for physical deployment.
- [legged-robots-manipulation](https://github.com/aCodeDog/legged-robots-manipulation): Control references for the go2w robot.
- [Wheel Legged Gym](https://github.com/clearlab-sustech/Wheel-Legged-Gym/tree/master): Control references for the wheel-legged robot.
